## Why I made this project?

This is part of a series of self-taught projects to consolidate my knowledge of react.js. In this project I learned:

#### Frontend

- Lifting up state.
- Use useEffect and useState hooks.
- Conditionally render JSX based in props.
- Link react logic with components to improve UX.
- Use PropTypes checking in each component.
